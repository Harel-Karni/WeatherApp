# WeatherApp
First project on Python

A weather app displays weather in different cities around the world according to a predefined list.

In addition, three users are registered in the app, each with the following settings:

  * Display preferences for a selected city
  * Different measurement units (metric, imperial, and Kelvin) for displaying city data

When entering the app, the data for the default city is displayed, as well as the **Temp. Scale units** - Celsius.

When selecting a user from the list - the selected city will change according to the user's preferences. The scale units will be displayed in the user's **Temp. Scale units**.


The project was published using the **Streamlit** App (https://streamlit.io)

Weather data was received from the website https://openweathermap.org

The city's location on the world map was done using the map object of the app and longitude and latitude coordinates received from the website https://openweathermap.org
