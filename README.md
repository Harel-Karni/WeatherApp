# WeatherApp
First project on Python

A weather app displays weather in different cities around the world according to a predefined list.

In addition, three users are registered in the app, each with the following settings:

  * Display preferences for a selected city
  * Different measurement units (metric, imperial, and Kelvin) for displaying city data
When entering the app, the data for the default city is displayed, as well as the default measurement units = Celsius.

After selecting a username, the displayed city will change according to the user's preferences and the data will be displayed in the user's measurement units.

The project was published using the streamlit app.

Weather data was received from the website https://openweathermap.org

The city's location on the world map was done using the map object of the app and longitude and latitude coordinates received from the website https://openweathermap.org
